### Configuring 

System-level configuration, for the entire computer
c:\Program Files (x86)\Git\etc\gitconfig. Accessed by:

	git config --system

User-level configuration, stored in c:\users\<name>.gitconfig

	git config --global


Repository level configuration, stored .git/config

	git config


Show all global options

	git config --global --list

Setting properties on global

	git config --global user.name
	git config --global user.email

Configuring core editor

	git config --global core.editor "'C:/Program Files (x86)/Notepad++/notepad++.exe' -multiInst -notabbar -nosession -noPlugin"

Configuring beyond compare

    git config --global diff.tool bc3
    git config --global difftool.bc3.path "c:/program files (x86)/beyond compare 3/bcomp.exe"
    git config --global difftool.prompt false
    git config --global merge.tool bc3
    git config --global mergetool.bc3.path "c:/program files (x86)/beyond compare 3/bcomp.exe"
    git config --global mergetool.prompt false
    git config --global mergetool.keepbackup false
    git config --global mergetool.keeptemporaries false

Configuring auto correct for the git commands

	git config --global help.autocorrect 1

Use colors to show a lot of git information

	git config --global color.ui auto

Auto carriage return line feed. False is for windows only will submit it as is. True will convert. Input is for mac, it will convert crlf into lf.

	git config --global core.autocrlf false

To remove a setting 

	git config --unset user.name

You can also edit the config files yourself.

###Working Locally

####Creating a local repository

	git init
	git status
	git add file.txt
	git status
	git commit

Look at the history and see the commit SHA:
	
	git log

Add all modified/updated files

	get add -u

Commit with message

	git commit -m "Message"

To view the diffs between SHA1 hashes

	git diff dd2929..333322

Easier, latest commit is know as HEAD

	git diff HEAD~1..HEAD
	git diff HEAD~1..

Add all files including untracked files

	git add -A

Stage as two different commits, add specific files and then commit.

	git add file1.txt 
	git commit

####Deleting Files

Delete the file first. Then stage the deletion with 

	git add -u

Rename the file first then:

	git add -A


To clear out unstaged changed to the README.txt file

	git checkout README.txt

To do a global clear out, and remove all unstaged changes
	
	git reset --hard

To take out the last commit out of the repository and move back to the staging area, that way you can change that commit around

	git reset --soft HEAD~1
make changes

	git commit -m "reorganized commit"

To delete last commit and discard all the changes 

	git reset --hard HEAD~1

###Remove unstaged files

	git clean -n //what would it do
	git clean -f //performs the operation

#### .gitignore

Create a file that will list all of the files and directories that need to be omitted.

### Working Remote
clone repository 

    git clone https://....

see list of commits

    git log

commits per line

    git log --oneline

see number of commits

    git log --oneline | wc -1

see the graph
	
	git log --graph

Authors and commit messages

	git shortlog

Statistics about authors

	git shortlog -sne

Look at the specific commit

	git show HEAD
	git show HEAD~10
	git show 939393

Look at the remotes, origin is the git default where the repository came from

	git remote
	git remote -v //verbose shows remote  urls

To see the repository config
	
	cat .get/config

Display all the branches in the repository

	git branch

Display all the remote branches

	git branch -r

Look at the tags, known stable versions

	git tags

To add a remote repository, is commonly down to evaluate patches and pull requests into your project

	git remote add origin https://github.com/....

Once remote repository is added you can

	git fetch  //all 
	git fetch origin

to see changes on remote repository

	get log origin/master

Merge remote branch into the your current branch

	git merge origin/master

Fast forward means, replay commits that happen if there were no other changes and move the HEAD

Shortcut for `git fetch; git merge origin/master` is

	git pull

To set your branch to mirror some other remote branch, or remote tracking branch, or upstream tracking.

	git branch --set-upstream master origin/master

If you can also specify without setting the remote like this. origin is the remote name and master is the remote branch.

	git pull origin master

Git commit and add modified files together

	git commit -am "Some message"

Push your changes to the remote
	
	git push

To remove the origin on the current branch

	git remote rm origin

to tag a current version, or stable point

	git tag v1.0.0

to create tag with the annotation

	git tag -a v1.0

To create a tag with the signature, signed with the password

	git tag -s v1.0

To verify a tag

	git tag -v v1.0


To push tags to remote (by default git would not push tags)

	git push --tags


## Branching Merging and Rebasing with Git

list of the commits on the current branch with a graph

	git log --graph --oneline

To visualize all branches, decorate applies the branch and tag information

	git lot --graph --oneline --all --decorate

Adding aliases in the git config

    git config --global alias.lga "log --graph --oneline --all --decorate"
    git config --global alias.lg "log --graph --pretty=format:'%C(bold)%h%Creset -%C(auto)%d%Creset %s %C(green dim)(%cr)%Creset %C(ul)<%an>'"
    git lga
    git lg
    cat ~/.gitconfig

To Create a new branch
	
	git branch feature1

Checkout new branch 

	git checkout feature1

Big difference between branches and tags is that tags always stay on the same commit where branches move along.

	git checkout master 

Create a branch from a specific commit

	git branch fix1 9929292
	git checkout fix1

To rename a branch is to move it

	git branch -m fix1 bug1234

To delete a branch 

	git branch -d bug1234

To force delete a branch

	git branch -D bug1234

To create a branch and checkout (shortcut)
	
	git checkout -b feature2

To get back a deleted branch. From a dangling commit, a commit that doesn't have a home. These are kept for 30 days. 

	git reflog // log of all references
	git branch bug1234 5a78c8b //with the first 8 of the SHA

To see head

	git show HEAD


Save half completed work is to stash it. Temporary holding area for the changes that are not committed to the branch. 

	git stash
	git status
	git stash list //holding area
	git stash apply //to pull the changes back
	git stash pop //applies it and removes it from the list

###Merging 

Merge fiture1 into the current branch

	git merge feature1
	git branch -d feature1 //deletes unused branch

Fast forward merge, is just moving the branch label into the new location.

To resolve conflicts using the merge tool

	git mergetool

Compare the repository to the staging area

	git diff --cached


###Rebasing

You can play back your commits on a certain branch rather creating a branch if there are no conflicts. Rebase current branch on top of master

	git rebase master

You can also use mergetool to solve merge conflicts and then continue

	git rebase --continue

###Cherry Pick

If you need to get one commit and apply it on top of a branch.

	git cherrypick sks939ss


#Working with remote

	git fetch origin master //get latests
	git push origin master 

to push a branch to remote 

	git push origin v1.0_fixes

list remote branches

	git branch -r

To delete remote branch, push to the remote without specifying the local name

	git push origin :v1.0_fixes_remote_branch_name
