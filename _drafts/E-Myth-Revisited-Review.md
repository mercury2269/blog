Engineer's Point Of View
------------------------

As a part of my transition of being a "wantrepreneuer" to entrepreneur. I've
been indulging on great amount of business and motivational literature. One of
them that I've listened recently and was highly recommended is [The E-Myth
Revisited: Why Most Small Businesses Don't Work and What to Do About It][1]. The
book has a lot of great concepts that are simple and sometimes almost obvious,
but sometimes it takes someone else's perspective to realize something obvious
and that book provides exactly that. The following summary has some points that
struct some chords with me and I want to make sure I can remember in the future.

Three Personalities To Run A Business
-------------------------------------

First idea in the book is the following; Entrepreneuer, manager and technician
are the three crucial roles that your business must posses in order to be
successful. **The most important is that all three must be equal in strength and
energy** or otherwise you are destined to fail. For example when a passionate
developer, or a technician like myself decides that he or she wants to build a
business, he start with what he knows the most, and that is building the
product. However since the only thing that a technician know is building a
product he ends up doing that for 85% of the time and maybe 10% would be spent
on being entrepreneur and 5% spent management. I completely agree and admit that
I have failed that principle before. I think I lack any kind of entrepreneur or
manager knowledge and experience so I just do what I know and that is build. The
book made me realize that I need to learn and master the other 2 aspects of
business in order to be successful.
