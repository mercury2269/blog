## From Technitian Point Of View 
I love programming, I enjoy building things, mastering engineering craft, and learning. And like many software developers, who are high achivers, I dream that one day I can take all that wealth of knowledge, pragmatism, and problem solving ability and create my own company. When I think of building a company I think of building a perfect product. Something that's technically perfect, follows all good object oriented design principles, has a good suite of unit tests along with automated regression tests, something that's easy to maintain and can be easily changed. It would use the best tools for the job, not just latest and shiniest.

I've been always wondering how the majority of successful companies with poorly designed and implemented software can stay in business. 

## From Technitian To Entrepreneuer
This book answered a lot of questions about why my past ventures have misirably failed. First of all, when someone like me, a technitian, starts a business he or she has a wrong mindset. A well run business has 3 equally important parts: entreprenureal, managerial and technical. Entreprenureal is where you see opportunities, a vision, you are able to figure out what is missing and can anticipate future. Managerial is where you make sure everything is in order, things get done and the system is followed perfectly. And technical is where you build the actual product. When a developer starts working a product he focuses mostly on the technical part, the only thing that he sees is that perfect product, not realizing that in order for business to succeed you need all 3 parts. So you spent all that time and energy later to realize that your vision was correctly wrong and either nobody needs your product, or your strategy is poorly executed.
