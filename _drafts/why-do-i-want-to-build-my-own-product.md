Oh The Captivating World Of Business
------------------------------------

I have a lot of great information that I'd like to share. But first I need to
start from the beginning and set the stage of where I'm coming from.

I trully enjoy programming. To me it's the best job in the world. The best thing
about it is that it has no limit how much you can learn and how much better you
can get. I've been actively improving and studing for about 8 years and there is
still so much more I'd like to learn. I think the more I learn the more I
realize that I need more knowledge.

And like many engineers I passionately want to build my own thing. I would take
all that accumulated wealth of knowledge, pragmatism, and problem solving
ability and create a great application or a product. It would follow all the
good object oriented design principles, have an extensive suite of unit tests
and it will be easy to maintain and to change.

I have been building products for companies for a really long time. And it
worked out great for me, but I've always had a desire to be independent
