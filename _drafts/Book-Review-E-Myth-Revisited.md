As a part of my transition of being a "wantrepreneuer" to entrepreneur, I've
been indulging in great amount of business and motivational content. While listening on my way to work to one of my favorite podcasts, [The Entrepreneur On Fire][1], one of the guests recommended a book that he said completely shifted his mindset about business and put all the pieces together. It got me interested and picked up a copy from audible.com. So this post is dedicated to the review of the [The E-Myth
Revisited: Why Most Small Businesses Don't Work and What to Do About It][2]. 
The following is the summary of the concepts that I thought were valuable and my reflections on this ideas. 

## Three Critical Roles
In order to have a business that's going to stand the test of time and continue growing, you need to have the following three roles: Entrepreneur, Manager and Technician. All three must be equal in strength, energy and amount of time devoted to it. Entrepreneur does the strategic thinking, planning, innovation and has a vision for the future. Manager makes sure the established process gets followed, she makes sure stuff gets done and brings order to the chaos. And technician works on the product itself. 

Because software engineers are great at building things, we don't necessarily notice or pay enough attention that we lack other equally important roles in our business. We concentrate almost all of our energy on building things, which is only a one third of a successful business. 

## Work On Your Business Rather Than In
When you work in your business, you become self employed. Working on your business means developing it and creating a system so you can leverage other people's time and grow your business. The system has to be well established and easy enough to be followed by your future employees. 

This is where I have a lot to learn. While working on the idea, I really need to put together a list of things that can be complete by other people and not try doing everything myself. Even development work can be outsourced, I understand it won't be as good as something that you would write, but I think it's up to me to create a system that will have quality checks built in. As entrepreneur there must be other more important tasks like talking to potential customers and figuring out their pain points rather than creating a perfect data access layer. 

## Divide Roles And Assign Accountable

When starting a new venture, it's important to write down all the positions that you envision your business will have as it matures. For example, you will have a Chief Executive Officer, a Chief Operating Officer (COO), a Vice President of Sale, and VP of Marketing, VP of Operations, all kinds of Managers and staff and so
on. Once you write all those positions down you assign people who will be responsible for those roles. You might end up for 12 or more roles. If it's just you and your partner then each of you will have many roles. So you would divide roles and hold whoever got that role accountable. So if one of your roles is a VP of Marketing then it's your responsibility to bring customer into the door and you have all the decision making ability in that domain. It is also important to have a different mindset when performing a job, you must make a mental shift and think to your self that right now I'm performing job x and from that position I'll be making my decisions and take actions from that position. 

When your business starts to grow, you will slowly hire people to take some of your responsibilities and you will no longer be responsible for it.

So that I don't make the same mistake twice, I will work on making sure that roles are clearly divided when I start a new venture. I've had many experiences starting with partners and arguing over many different subjects. Now I see that the problem was that we didn't have a clearly established roles and people assigned. If you got a role of VP of Marketing then it's your final decision on how you want to send out those email campaigns and not a guy who does your development work. Finally, if you don't contribute and your role is not being efficient you need to be fired or replaced from that role. 

## Create A System For Average Skilled
If your business depends on a person who is a genius then you really can't replace that person, and if he or she leaves you would be out of business. Building a business in a way where an average person can perform a job well is very important because now you can hire anyone and your quality doesn't suffer. You add safety nets and create checklists to ensure quality is met.  

## Focus On Building A Business Rather Than Building A Product
Building a system is more important than building a product. A successful business can build many different products and can change them and adapt to the market. If you lock yourself in to a specific product then you are really in a disadvantage because any shift in market and you will be out of your job.
